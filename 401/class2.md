# Testing and Modules

## Testing
### Unit tests and TDD?
Probably there are million of blog posts about this subject. But letâ€™s talk just a bit about it on my point of view! ðŸ˜…

Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

### The freela
Imagine that a client has a website and through it he receives a lot of contacts from potential customers. After a while he realized that it is important for the business to identify the profile of consumer: age, gender, job and so on. But the website just receive the name and the email.
They hired you to identify the gender of a person based on his/her name. Luckily, there is an amazing API called Genderize.io that identifies the possible genders. And you quickly developed your API connection:

```
requests.get('https://api.genderize.io/?name=ana')
```
### Baby Steps

The API is pretty straightforward and your work was almost done. But with TDD we need to think about tests first. And to be ok with the possibility of the beginning to be hard sometimes â€” and itâ€™s totally fine. Really.
Coming back to the code and thinking with baby steps, what is the smaller test that we can do against a function (method/class) that will return the gender?

### Important aspects about the unit test

```
def test_should_return_female_when_the_name_is_from_female_gender():
    detector = GenderDetector()
    expected_gender = detector.run(â€˜Anaâ€™)
    assert expected_gender == â€˜femaleâ€™
```
There are some details to pay attention. The first one is the test name. The tests can be considered as your alive documentation. We need to be descriptive about it and to say what is expected and what we are testing. In this case we explicitly said: `should return female when the name is from a female.`

The test file name should follow the same name of module name. For instance, if our module is `gender.py`, our test name should be `test_gender.py`. Itâ€™s ideal to separate the tests folder from production code (the implementation) and to have something like this:

```
mymodule/
 â€” module.py
 â€” another_folder/
 â€” â€” another_module.py
tests/
 â€” test_module.py
 â€” another_folder/
 â€” â€” test_another_module.py
```
### Recursion

> What is Recursion?

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.

> A Mathematical Interpretation

Let us consider a problem that a programmer have to determine the sum of first n natural numbers, there are several ways of doing that but the simplest approach is simply add the numbers starting from 1 to n. So the function simply looks like,approach(1) â€“ Simply adding one by one
`f(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 +â€¦â€¦..+ n`

> What is base condition in recursion?

In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems. 

```
int fact(int n)
{
    if (n < = 1) // base case
        return 1;
    else    
        return n*fact(n-1);    
}
```

In the above example, base case for n < = 1 is defined and larger value of number can be solved by converting to smaller one till base case is reached.
