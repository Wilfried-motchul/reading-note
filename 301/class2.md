# PAIR PROGRAMMING

## 6 Reason for Pair Programming

More “two heads are better than one” than “stop reading over my shoulder,” pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.

> How does pair programming work?

Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.
The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.

> Why pair program?

Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

Here are other reasion for paring programming:

* Greater efficiency 
* Engaged colaboration
* Learning from fellow studten
* Social sKills
* Job interview readiness
* Work environment readiness


# JQUERY

jQuery offers tasks for JS
it is simpler to access elements using jQuery selectors rather than to use DOM queries
lets you update the DOM tree, animate elements in and out of view, and can loop through a set of elements in one line of code
handles events through methods
find elements using css style selectors a. `$()` often used as a shorthand... $`('li.hot')` b. selects li elements with a class of hot
Do something with the elements using Jquery methods a. `$('li.hot')`.addClass('complete');
in order to use Jquery, you first must include in the script
benefits of cross-browser comptability
Single Element

if a selector returns just one element `$('ul')`, the JQuery object contains a reference to one node

# Selectors
jQuery can use all of the CSS selector methods you might be familiar with, plus quite a few bonus methods.

Some JQ speciic bonus selectors:

`:input` - input elements
`:image` - all images
`:hidden` - hidden elements
`:visibile` - visible elements
`:animated` - elements currently being animated
many many more, look them up and play with them
