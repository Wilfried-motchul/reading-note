### what is HTML 
HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language, is a standard for describing the structure and presentation of information via the Internet.
Web developers use HTML keywords or tags to instruct the Web browser application how to format and display the content of Web pages.
HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives authors the means to:
Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.
Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.
Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.
Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.
With HTML, authors describe the structure of pages using markup. The elements of the language label pieces of content such as “paragraph,” “list,” “table,” and so on.
