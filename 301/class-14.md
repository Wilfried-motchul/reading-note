# Database Normalization 
## Introduction to Database Normalization

Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included. Take a spreadsheet containing the information as an example, where the data contains salespeople and customers serving several purposes:
* Identify salespeople in your organization
* List all customers your company calls upon to sell a product
* Identify which salespeople call on specific customers

## Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies

Notice that for each SalesPerson we have listed both the SalesOffice and OfficeNumber. There are duplicate salesperson data. Duplicated information presents two problems:

* It increases storage and decrease performance.
* It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.

## Insert Anomaly
There are facts we cannot record until we know information for the entire row.  In our example we cannot record a new sales office until we also know the sales person.  Why?  Because in order to create the record, we need provide a primary key.  In our case this is the EmployeeID.
## Update Anomaly
In this case we have the same information in several rows. For instance if the office number changes, then there are multiple updates that need to be made.  If we donâ€™t update all rows, then inconsistencies appear.
